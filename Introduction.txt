Brief Introduction About Myself
Hi, my name is Abdelhadi Mouhib, but I usually go by Abid. I'm a fashion design student and a small business owner based in Casablanca. I specialize in upcycling and sustainable fashion, turning old clothes and materials into new, stylish creations through crochet and design.
I'm also passionate about studying and living abroad, currently enrolled in a pathway program to prepare for international opportunities in fashion business. I'm driven by curiosity, craftsmanship, and a strong desire to contribute to a more ethical and creative fashion industry.
